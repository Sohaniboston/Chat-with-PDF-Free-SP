## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended Method)

### Option 1: Use Conda Environment (Easiest)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohaniboston/Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP.git
   cd Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP
   ```

2. **Create conda environment from file:**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate chat_with_pdf
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohaniboston/Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP.git
   cd Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP
   ```

2. **Create and activate conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n chat_with_pdf python=3.9 -y
   conda activate chat_with_pdf
   ```

3. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration (Optional)

### For Better Performance (Still Free!)
Get a free HuggingFace token for faster responses:

1. Sign up at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) (free)
2. Get your token: [Settings → Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
3. Create `.env` file:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

### OpenAI Support (Optional)
If you have OpenAI credits, add to `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_hf_token_here
```

*Note: The app works perfectly without any API keys!*

## 📖 Usage Guide

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   conda activate chat_with_pdf
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface:**  
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:8502`

3. **Upload your PDFs:**  
   - Drag and drop PDF files in the sidebar
   - Supports multiple PDFs simultaneously
   - Click "Process" to analyze documents

4. **Start chatting:**  
   - Ask questions about your documents
   - Get instant, intelligent responses
   - Maintains conversation context

### Example Questions:
- "What is the main topic of this document?"
- "Summarize the key findings"
- "What does it say about [specific topic]?"
- "Who is mentioned in this document?"

## 🧠 How It Works (Technical Overview)

This application uses a sophisticated **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach:

1. **PDF Processing** - Extracts text from uploaded documents
2. **Text Chunking** - Breaks content into manageable pieces  
3. **Embeddings** - Converts text to numerical representations
4. **Vector Storage** - Creates searchable knowledge base (FAISS)
5. **Smart Retrieval** - Finds relevant content for questions
6. **AI Generation** - Produces human-like responses

### AI Models Used:
- **Embeddings**: `hkunlp/instructor-xl` (HuggingFace)
- **Chat**: `google/flan-t5-large` (HuggingFace)  
- **Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 (if API key provided)

## 🔄 Smart Fallback System

The app automatically handles different scenarios:

```
1. Try OpenAI (if API key available)
   ⬇️ (if quota exceeded or no key)
2. Switch to HuggingFace models (free)
   ⬇️ (if token available)
3. Use public inference (still free, may be slower)
```

No matter what, **your app always works!**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No text found in PDF"**
- PDF might be image-based (scanned)
- Solution: Use OCR software first

**"Processing takes long time"**
- Large documents take time on first run
- HuggingFace models download on first use
- Subsequent runs are faster

**"Error creating vector store"**
- Check internet connection
- Restart the application
- Try with smaller PDF files first

**"Weird or incorrect answers"**
- Ensure PDFs contain the information you're asking about
- Try more specific questions
- Check if text was extracted correctly

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **PDF Quality**: Use text-based PDFs rather than scanned images
2. **Question Specificity**: Ask specific questions for better answers  
3. **Document Size**: Under 50 pages per PDF works best
4. **Clear Formatting**: Well-formatted documents give better results
