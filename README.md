## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended Method)

### Option 1: Use Conda Environment (Easiest)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohaniboston/Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP.git
   cd Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP
   ```

2. **Create conda environment from file:**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate chat_with_pdf
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohaniboston/Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP.git
   cd Chat-with-PDF-Free-SP
   ```

2. **Create and activate conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n chat_with_pdf python=3.9 -y
   conda activate chat_with_pdf
   ```

3. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration (100% Optional!)

### 🚀 **Works Out of the Box - No Setup Required!**

The app runs perfectly **without any API keys or tokens**. Just run it and start chatting with your PDFs!

### For Better Performance (Still Free!)
**Optional**: Get a free HuggingFace token for faster responses:

1. Sign up at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) (free, no credit card)
2. Get your token: [Settings → Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
3. Create `.env` file:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

**Performance Comparison:**
- **Without token**: Works great, ~10-30 seconds per response
- **With free token**: Same quality, ~5-15 seconds per response
- **Both are unlimited and completely free!**

### OpenAI Support (Optional)
If you have OpenAI credits, add to `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_hf_token_here
```

**🎯 Bottom Line: The app works perfectly without any API keys or registrations!**

## 📖 Usage Guide

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   conda activate chat_with_pdf
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface:**  
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:8502`

3. **Upload your PDFs:**  
   - Drag and drop PDF files in the sidebar
   - Supports multiple PDFs simultaneously
   - Click "Process" to analyze documents

4. **Start chatting:**  
   - Ask questions about your documents
   - Get instant, intelligent responses
   - Maintains conversation context

### Example Questions:
- "What is the main topic of this document?"
- "Summarize the key findings"
- "What does it say about [specific topic]?"
- "Who is mentioned in this document?"

## 🧠 How It Works (Technical Overview)

This application uses a sophisticated **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach with enhanced reliability:

1. **PDF Processing** - Extracts text from uploaded documents with detailed feedback
2. **Text Chunking** - Breaks content into manageable pieces with overlap prevention  
3. **Embeddings** - Converts text to numerical representations using cached models
4. **Vector Storage** - Creates searchable knowledge base (FAISS) with error handling
5. **Smart Retrieval** - Finds relevant content for questions with retry mechanisms
6. **AI Generation** - Produces human-like responses with improved question formatting

### AI Models Used (Updated):
- **Embeddings**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (HuggingFace, cached)
- **Chat**: `google/flan-t5-small` (HuggingFace, optimized for reliability)  
- **Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 (if API key provided)
- **Model Caching**: Uses `@st.cache_resource` for faster subsequent loads

### New Error Handling Features:
- **Retry Mechanisms** - Automatically retries failed requests up to 3 times
- **StopIteration Handling** - Graceful handling of model timeout issues
- **User-Friendly Messages** - Clear explanations and solution suggestions
- **Warning Suppression** - Clean console output with reduced noise

## 🔄 Smart Processing System

The app now features an **intelligent 3-way selection system**:

### Processing Flow:
```
User Selects Mode in Sidebar
    ⬇️
🆓 HF No Token → Uses public inference (completely free)
    ⬇️
⚡ HF With Token → Uses API token (free account, faster)
    ⬇️
💨 OpenAI → Uses GPT models (paid, fastest)
```

### Smart Fallbacks:
- **OpenAI quota exceeded** → Automatically switches to HuggingFace
- **HuggingFace timeout** → Retry mechanism with clear user feedback
- **Token issues** → Falls back to public inference
- **Network problems** → Detailed error messages with solutions

**No matter what, your app always works!**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**"Model didn't respond" / StopIteration Errors**
- **What it means**: HuggingFace public inference is overloaded
- **Solutions**: 
  - Wait 2-3 minutes and try again
  - Ask shorter, simpler questions
  - Get a free HuggingFace token for better reliability
  - Switch to OpenAI mode if you have credits

**"No text found in PDF"**
- PDF might be image-based (scanned)
- Solution: Use OCR software first or try a different PDF

**"Processing takes long time"**
- Large documents take time on first run
- HuggingFace models download on first use (cached afterward)
- Subsequent runs are much faster due to caching

**"Error creating vector store"**
- Check internet connection for model downloads
- Restart the application to clear cache
- Try with smaller PDF files first

**Console Warnings (FutureWarning, etc.)**
- These are now suppressed in the latest version
- Warnings don't affect functionality
- Restart the app if you see persistent warnings

**"Timeout" or "Connection" Errors**
- Network issues or server overload
- The app will automatically retry 3 times
- Try switching to a different processing mode

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **PDF Quality**: Use text-based PDFs rather than scanned images
2. **Question Specificity**: Ask specific questions for better answers  
3. **Document Size**: Under 50 pages per PDF works best
4. **Clear Formatting**: Well-formatted documents give better results
